TravelIt is a travel planning platform that allows users to book their entire journey in one place — including flights, trains, buses, and optional home-to-airport/train station taxi services.
The platform eliminates the need to use multiple apps by enabling users to plan and confirm all travel components in a single, seamless flow.
